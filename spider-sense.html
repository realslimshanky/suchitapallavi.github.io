            <p>I found an issue on Github which was posted by a friend and the description was there to change the design to make it more appealing.</p>

            <p>I did some competition analysis and user research by conducting interview for the existing product and found out the problems which were being faced by the users.</p>
            <p>I found out that the main problem was UI so I worked mostly on the UI keeping the users in the mind at all times.</p>

            <p>The major reason portrayed by the user was that the look and feel of the product was not catchy. They were finding it difficult to use the product as there was too much information on the page.</p>
