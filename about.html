                        I am a former management student, turned UX professional. After graduating from my college, I decided to go for a field which suits my personality.
                        <br />
                        UX design appealed to me because all my soft skills which I learned during my management course fitted so perfectly. During my college, I went through a lot of research and thesis which worked as a cherry on the top while learning UX principles and applying it on my projects.

                        In my free time I usually prefer to draw. To grow my hobby even further, I started my Instagram page. I have used so many digital platforms such as procreate and Krita and have a good grip over there that I can happily call myself a digital artist.
